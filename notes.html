AAA 20141009 working to redirect requests for images from LiveOcean blob storage to Ice2Ocean blob storage: 
    -created ice2ocean blob name/container and replicated the L.O. field table in ice2oceanfields
    -changed names accordingly in 'settings.py'
    -put a few sample pngs in ice2ocean (still using L.O. images)
    -tested and API returns those images correctly

    -CONFUSION: "STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME" AND "STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY" not accessed in current L.O. version.
     Instead L.O. storage location is set to laplace/mapping in Ln16 of 'builder.py' in a line labeled 'Depreciated'. But when 
     you run the api the pngs get sent to lafayette/liveocean. I can't trace that yet in the code.
 
    -SOLVED: Nels says there are still some inconsistencies in naming that are being worked out.

    Working on api/getoverlay: the call to blob storage for the png is:
        body = cache.blobstore.get_blob_to_bytes('liveocean',json_request)
    -better instead to do: ?
        body = cache.blobstore.get_blob_to_bytes(connection_properties["STORAGE_CONTAINER"],json_request)
      for now I have:  body = cache.blobstore.get_blob_to_bytes('ice2ocean',json_request) which works fine

    -CONFUSION: images are currently being sent to the storage blob as JSON objects? If I manually try to download one image 
    using Azure Storage Explorer it doesn't produce a physical file. Unclear on whether the JSON object is the metadata/label pointing
    to a png? Probably will revert to parsing the JSON string from the http request and using that to select/name blob files for now.

    -SOLVED: Nels points out the Azure Storage Explorer has some bugs. Better to view in VS. Note the files do not have an extension.

    -there appear to be several formats currently accepted to make a request to the API. There is the JSON string as I've been testing so
    far, which appears in the example on the splash page, and the (newer?) method Nels outlined in his last email:
            http://lo-api-test.azurewebsites.net/api/get-overlay?year=2014&hour=6359&param=NO3&depthMeters=-20.0&cmap=jet
    which presumably gives more control over plotting/colormaps and is a better method for indicating time? Each of these different
    request methods are encapsulated in several try/except combinations in api/getoverlay

    Working to modify api/extract_time to handle year,month,day timestamping (keep hourly in there for other potential cryo models)

    Changing the blob storage locations: snowmodel/snowmodel will be the location of the raw GRADS output. But, keeping the variable
    names the same for now (i.e. OCEAN_HIS) Kilroy says we should make these names more universal later.

Suggested changes:

builder.py, line 96: remove 'naming' function? Doesn't appear to be used?

AAA 20150216

ice2ocean stripped of most of the LiveOcen modules including: instance.py; makeitso.py; test_sect.py; zfun.py

Changed names of storage container variables to be more generic, in settings.py.
Creating new blob storage table for metadata reporting.
New restful.html documentation page on django with table explaining URI calls.
